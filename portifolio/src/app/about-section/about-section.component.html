      Currently, I am an open-source applications developer at Information
      Technology Institute, where I am acquiring valuable technical and soft
      skills. I graduated from the Faculty of Engineering at Cairo University in
      2023 with a very good overall grade, and an A+ for my graduation project.
      During my time at university, I participated with my team in the NLP
      Competition at Nile University AI Hackathon to solve a Named Entity
      Recognition problem, and we achieved fourth place out of ten teams.
      Moreover, I participated in the _VOIS Vantage 2022 Competition - Egypt
      Track with two of my friends to solve real-life strategy case studies and
      achieved first place ðŸ¥‡.
